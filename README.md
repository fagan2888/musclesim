# Artificial Muscle Simulator

[大阪大学 “ゆらぎ”プロジェクト](http://www.yuragi.osaka-u.ac.jp/) (2007)

Understanding and utilizing fluctuation effects is the motivation behind the interdisciplinary Yuragi Project. One specific application of this principle is the control of a complex, biologically inspired robotic arm based on the Attractor Selection Model. A simulator for the robot's artificial muscles has been developed in order to evaluate this approach. The Artificial Muscle Simulator introduces a model of the flexible pneumatic actuators which accurately reproduces their behavior. It has been designed to be highly customizable, allowing for other robot models and control methods.
